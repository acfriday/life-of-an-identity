# The Life of an Identity

The most common events in the life of an identity, which collectively manage the process of granting and revoking access to resources within an organization begin when an identity is either *provisioned* or *registered* with personal *identifiers* ***(such as an email address for a person or an IP address for a system)*** being provided and used as *attributes* that uniquely identify that *entity*; continues with *authentication* of that identity using an *account* which will be tied to the *entities* personal *identifiers*, includes steps for performing updates to an *entities* *attributes* and credentials over time; and ends when an identity is deactivated for *de-provisioning*.

We'll explore the events in the lifecycle of an identity in further detail below.
