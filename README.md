# The Life of an Identity

The most common events in the life of an identity, which collectively manage the process of granting and revoking access to resources within an organization begin when an identity is either provisioned or registered with personal identifiers *(such as an email address for a person or an IP address for a system)* being provided and used as attributes that uniquely identify that entity; continues with authentication of that identity using an account which will be tied to the entities personal identifiers, includes steps for performing updates to an entities attributes and credentials over time; and ends when an identity is deactivated for de-provisioning.

#### We'll explore the events in the lifecycle of an identity in further detail below:
