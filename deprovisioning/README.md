# Deprovisioning Digital Identities

Deprovisioning is the act of removing a user's access to internal applications when an identity needs to be offboarded entirely from an organization, or temporarily disabled for various reasons with one common reason being an investigation into actions performed by the account until the owner can be cleared of any wrongdoing. Deprovisioning is a critical security process designed to ensure sensitive internal resources are protected from future access, and account data is properly discarded excluding any data required for future auditing.
