Provisioning refers to the process of creating and managing digital identities within an organization. This can be initiated in multiple ways: users may enter personal information through a web registration form, employee data might be automatically transferred from an HR system to external identity services like Microsoft Entra ID or Keycloak for account creation, or administrators might use APIs to programmatically set up user or device accounts.

For example, an administrator can use Python to interact with Keycloak's Admin Client API and add a new account for a staff member to their organization's Realm.
