# Provisioning Digital Identities

Provisioning refers to the process of creating and managing digital identities within an organization. This can be initiated in multiple ways:

### User Triggered Registration

Web registration forms that allow end-users to manually input their personal information to create an account.

### Automated Transfer of Employee Data

Employee data can be automatically transferred from an HR system over to external identity services like Microsoft Entra ID or Keycloak for account creation.

### Programmatic Provisioning by Administrators

Administrators with proper privileges can use APIs to programmatically set up user or device accounts.

## Example - Provisioning with Keycloak's Admin REST API
An administrator can use Keycloak's admin REST API to provision an account for a staff member to their organization's Realm
